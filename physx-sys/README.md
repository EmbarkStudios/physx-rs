Unsafe automatically-generated Rust bindings for [NVIDIA PhysX 4.1](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX) C++ API.

Please also see the [repository](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/physx-rs) containing a work-in-progress safe wrapper.

## Presentation

[Tomasz Stachowiak](https://github.com/h3r2tic) did a presentation at the Stockholm Rust Meetup on October 2019 about this project that goes through the technical details of how C++ to Rust bindings of `physx-sys` works:

## Basic usage

```Rust
unsafe {
    let foundation = physx_create_foundation();
    let physics = physx_create_physics(foundation);

    let mut scene_desc = PxSceneDesc_new(PxPhysics_getTolerancesScale(physics));
    scene_desc.gravity = PxVec3 {
        x: 0.0,
        y: -9.81,
        z: 0.0,
    };

    let dispatcher = PxDefaultCpuDispatcherCreate(2, null_mut());

    scene_desc.cpuDispatcher = dispatcher as *mut PxCpuDispatcher;
    scene_desc.filterShader = Some(PxDefaultSimulationFilterShader);

    let scene = PxPhysics_createScene_mut(physics, &scene_desc);

    // Your physics simulation goes here
}
```

## Examples

### [Ball](examples/ball.rs)

A simple example to showcase how to use physx-sys. It can be run with `cargo run --examples ball`.

## How it works

The binding is generated using a custom C++ app written against clang's [libtooling](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html). It queries the compiler's abstract syntax tree, and maps the C++ PhysX functions and types to Rust using heuristics chosen specifically for this SDK. It is not a general C++ <-> Rust binding generator, and using it on other projects *will* likely crash and burn.

Since C++ does not have a standardized and stable ABI, it's generally not safe to call it from Rust code; since PhysX exposes a C++ interface, we can't use it directly. That's why `physx-sys` generates both a Rust interface as well as a plain C wrapper. The C code is compiled into a static library at build time, and Rust then talks to C.

In order to minimize the amount of work required to marshall data between the C wrapper and the original C++ API, we generate a **bespoke C wrapper for each build target**. The wrapper is based on metadata about structure layout extracted directly from compiling and running a tiny program against the PhysX SDK using the specific C++ compiler used in the build process.

The build process comprises a few steps:

1. The `pxbind` utility uses `clang` to extract metadata about PhysX functions and types, and generates partial Rust and C bindings as `physx_generated.hpp` and `physx_generated.rs`. Those contain all function definitions, and a small subset of types. It also generates a C++ utility called `structgen` by emitting `structgen.cpp`.
2. `structgen` is compiled against the PhysX SDK, and generates all the remaining type wrappers. For each struct, it queries the size and offset of its members, and generates `structgen_out.hpp` and `structgen_out.rs`. The types are "plain old data" structs which will perfectly match the memory layout of the C++ types.
3. All the generated C types are compiled together to form `physx_api`, a static library for Rust to link with.
4. The Rust wrapper is compiled, and linked with PhysX and the C wrapper.

Steps *2..4* are performed completely automatically from within `build.rs`, while step *1* is only necessary when upgrading the PhysX SDK or modifying the generator. As such, building and running `pxbind` is a manual task, and is currently only supported on \*nix systems.
