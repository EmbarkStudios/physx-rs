//! Unsafe automatically-generated Rust bindings for [NVIDIA PhysX 4.1](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX) C++ API.
//!
//! Please also see the [repository](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/physx-rs) containing a work-in-progress safe wrapper.
//!
//! ## Presentation
//!
//! [Tomasz Stachowiak](https://github.com/h3r2tic) did a presentation at the Stockholm Rust Meetup on October 2019
//! about this project that goes through the tecnical details of how C++ to Rust bindings of `physx-sys` works:
//!
//! [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/RxtXGeDHu0w/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxtXGeDHu0w "An unholy fusion of
//! Rust and C++ in physx-rs (Stockholm Rust Meetup, October 2019)")
//!
//!
//! ## Basic usage
//!
//! ```Rust
//! unsafe {
//!     let foundation = physx_create_foundation();
//!     let physics = physx_create_physics(foundation);
//!
//!     let mut scene_desc = PxSceneDesc_new(PxPhysics_getTolerancesScale(physics));
//!     scene_desc.gravity = PxVec3 {
//!         x: 0.0,
//!         y: -9.81,
//!         z: 0.0,
//!     };
//!
//!     let dispatcher = PxDefaultCpuDispatcherCreate(2, null_mut());
//!
//!     scene_desc.cpuDispatcher = dispatcher as *mut PxCpuDispatcher;
//!     scene_desc.filterShader = Some(PxDefaultSimulationFilterShader);
//!
//!     let scene = PxPhysics_createScene_mut(physics, &scene_desc);
//!
//!     // Your physics simulation goes here
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### [Ball](examples/ball.rs)
//!
//! A simple example to showcase how to use physx-sys. It can be run with `cargo run --examples ball`.

//!          o                                o                 o oo         oooooooooo oo
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! The binding is generated using a custom C++ app written against clang's
//! [libtooling](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html). It queries the compiler's abstract syntax tree, and maps
//! the C++ PhysX functions and types to Rust using heuristics chosen specifically for this SDK. It is not a general
//! C++ <-> Rust binding generator, and using it on other projects *will* likely crash and burn.
//!
//! Since C++ does not have a standardized and stable ABI, it's generally not safe to call it from Rust code; since
//! PhysX exposes a C++ interface, we can't use it directly. That's why `physx-sys` generates both a Rust interface as
//! well as a plain C wrapper. The C code is compiled into a static library at build time, and Rust then talks to C.
//!
//! In order to minimize the amount of work required to marshall data between the C wrapper and the original C++ API, we
//! generate a **bespoke C wrapper for each build target**. The wrapper is based on metadata about structure layout
//! extracted directly from compiling and running a tiny program against the PhysX SDK using the specific C++ compiler
//! used in the build process.
//!
//! The build process comprises a few steps:
//!
//! 1. The `pxbind` utility uses `clang` to extract metadata about PhysX functions and types, and generates partial
//! Rust and C bindings as `physx_generated.hpp` and `physx_generated.rs`. Those contain all function definitions, and
//! a small subset of types. It also generates a C++ utility called `structgen` by emitting `structgen.cpp`.
//! 2. `structgen` is compiled against the PhysX SDK, and generates all the remaining type wrappers. For each struct, it
//! queries the size and offset of its members, and generates `structgen_out.hpp` and `structgen_out.rs`. The types are
//! "plain old data" structs which will perfectly match the memory layout of the C++ types.
//! 3. All the generated C types are compiled together to form `physx_api`, a static library for Rust to link with.
//! 4. The Rust wrapper is compiled, and linked with PhysX and the C wrapper.
//!
//! Steps *2..4* are performed completely automatically from within `build.rs`, while step *1* is only necessary when
//! upgrading the PhysX SDK or modifying the generator. As such, building and running `pxbind` is a manual task, and is
//! currently only supported on \*nix systems.
